Music Store Analysis

🎵 Excited to Share: Music Store Data Analysis Project! 📊

I'm thrilled to unveil my latest project: a comprehensive analysis of music store data, meticulously crafted using SQL. 🎶

🔍 Dive Deep: This project delves into three tiers of questions—easy, moderate, and advanced—each designed to unlock insights into the music store's operations and customer behaviors. From straightforward queries to more complex analyses, every aspect of the data has been explored.

💡 Leveraging Advanced Techniques: Throughout this project, I've employed a range of SQL techniques, including GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, JOINS, WHERE clauses, sub-queries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and even window functions. These tools have allowed me to dissect the data with precision, uncovering patterns and trends that drive informed decision-making.

🏗️ Building the Foundation: The journey begins with the creation of a robust music_database, followed by the seamless importation of CSV files to populate the database. Before diving into analysis, a thorough examination of each table ensures data integrity and completeness.

📈 Unveiling Insights: With a keen eye for detail and a passion for data-driven storytelling, I've unearthed valuable insights from this project. From understanding customer preferences to optimizing inventory management, the findings offer actionable recommendations for enhancing business performance.
